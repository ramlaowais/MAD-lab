# MAD-lab
This repository contains a basic Flutter application developed for the Mobile Application Development Lab. The application features a simple user interface with a white background, a blue AppBar with a white title, and a centered self-introduction paragraph. The paragraph includes the student's name in bold, qualities in italics, and a star icon displayed alongside the text. The project demonstrates fundamental Flutter concepts, including UI customization, text styling, and widget usage. It was developed using Flutter and Visual Studio Code as part of an introductory exercise in mobile application development.
